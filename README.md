# py2expl3
Convert Python code to expl3 code. (INCOMPLETE)

This was a work-in-progress that I never complete
(I realize there are better ways to make TeX programming easier, which is done in my work-in-progress `pythonimmediate` and
`imperative` libraries).

Nevertheless the ast-match sub-library might be useful for a few things...?
